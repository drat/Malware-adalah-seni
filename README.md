# Malware as art

`💾️🦠️🖼️ℹ️📃️ Information about the perspective and philosophy about computer malware being a form of art.`

I believe that malware can be a form of creative digital art to a limited extent. There is some fun behind exploitng software vulnerabilites in unique ways. I was inspired by the YouTuber Dannoct1 and his series of malware showcases, and later, his `Viewer-made malware` series.

## Virtual machines

Virtual machines are a huge factor in malware that can be considered art. If malware has anti-VM source code, it is not applicable. Otherwise, if malware can exploit vulnerabilities in an operating system through a virtual machine (where the host computer is not harmed, unless ^anti-VM code) then it is perfectly fine, unless it hits one of the following exceptions:

## Exceptions

I believe that Ransomware is one of the hard exceptions to this idea, as ransomware is software that is only used while the ransom servers are available, and is not available for usage once its servers stop working. Ransomware typically isn't used creatively either.

I also feel that malware that is temporary (notably web server malware) is not a form of art, as it is temporary, and cannot be replicated in the future via virtual machines.
